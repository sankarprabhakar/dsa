Depending on the format string, the function may expect a sequence of additional arguments, each containing a pointer to allocated storage where the interpretation of the extracted characters is stored with the appropriate type.
There should be at least as many of these arguments as the number of values stored by the format specifiers. Additional arguments are ignored by the function.
These arguments are expected to be pointers: to store the result of a fscanf operation on a regular variable, its name should be preceded by the reference operator (&)
